    <h1>Discover</h1>
    As a member of Marymount's <a href="http://www.marymount.edu/Academics/Programs-of-Study/Discover-Research-Program">Discover</a> Committee I help organize the annual Student Research Conference and assist in other student research activities<br/><br/>

    I will be teaching a Discover 101 class in Fall 2015 focused on Data Science and prediction
    <ul>
      <li><b>Who will win the World Series: The Science and Technology of Making Predictions</b></li>
      <li>DSC-101-I, Monday, Thursday 02:45PM - 04:00PM, 4040, Room 501</li>
      <li>Inexpensive storage and computing has led to massive amounts of data being generated by business, science, and sports. Data Science – the process of extracting knowledge from large quantities of data – is providing advantages and insights to those who know how to work with this so-called Big Data. But what is Data Science? How does it work? How accurate is it? Is it hype, or, as the Harvard Business Review calls it, the “sexiest job of the 21st century”? In this course we’ll investigate Data Science from the science and technology to the real-world business and economic implications. Hands-on laboratory work and inquiry-based group projects will be used to make our own predictions and assess the predictions of others. We’ll look at Data Science in business, science, and sports... and see about predicting the winner of baseball’s World Series.
