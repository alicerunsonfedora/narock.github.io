<p>The team behind EarthArXiv is international, and has broad knowledge and diverse expertise. Through our discussions it has emerged that we share many of the same ideals on preprints. Yet, I don't pretend to speak for all of EarthArXiv. The following comments are my own and an attempt to answer some questions I've been receiving since the <a href="https://news.agu.org/press-release/earth-and-space-science-open-preprint-server-to-be-powered-by-agu-and-atypon">American Geophysical Union (AGU) announced the release of a preprint server</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Did you know this was coming?</span><br/>
Yes, we did. Several of us at EarthArXiv have been having discussions with AGU and they had mentioned it was coming. Although, I didn’t know the official release date until I saw yesterday's announcement. AGU has been open about their preprint intentions - to other archives and to the extent possible until their agreeement was formally in place. In particular, the AGU Senior Vice President, Publications, Brooks Hanson, has been in contact with our group several times in attempts to bring numerous societies, archives, and interested groups to the table to discuss preprint topics.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Does this change your plans for EarthArXiv?</span><br/>
No, this doesn’t change our plans. Myself, and I believe, many more within EarthArXiv, have fundamental philosophical concerns with AGU's technical implementation plan. We favor a completely open approach independent of any publishers. We would like a community-led, transparent, and open source effort. The AGU approach is a contract with a major publisher and is built on top of proprietary software. This is not a specific criticism of AGU or Wiley. Publishers should be part of the discussions. Yet, it raises questions about the long term nature of the system when a publisher, any publisher, is doing the development. Questions that we think can be avoided by being open source and independent from the start.</p>

<p>For instance, the <a href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a>, who’s technology we’ll be using for EarthArXiv, is working with several publishers to provide an automated submission pipeline from the preprint system to a peer reviewed journal. After submitting a preprint and receiving comments, users will ultimately be able to select a journal of interest from a dropdown list, click a button, and have the latest version of their preprint sent off for peer review. The <a href="https://www.plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a> is developing similar extensions to preprints. We want to involve publishers in our preprint efforts. Yet, we think a vibrant ecosystem of advances emerges when the implementation of the preprint system is independent of any one publisher, the software is open source, and there is an open advisory/governance model. It remains to be seen to what extent, if at all, the community will be able to extend the AGU/Wiley Atypon system.</p>

<p>AGU is also very focused on conference posters, which I agree are valuable resources and should be captured. Yet, I think posters are fundamentally different than manuscript preprints and require a different set of concerns. Optical character recognition, extracting figures, and viewing posters on mobile devices are not easy challenges to overcome. I will utilize AGU's poster archiving and I wish them well in this effort. Yet, some of us with EarthArXiv have concerns about conflating posters and papers in one system.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Is this the end for AGU and EarthArXiv working together?</span><br/>
No. Not at all. Even though we disagree on the technical infrastructure, we very much agree with AGU on the need to bring all interested parties to the table to discuss best practices and higher level issues surrounding preprints. Just yesterday, I exchanged emails with Brooks Hanson. He welcomed the EarthArXiv effort to AGU’s continued discussions with other archives and societies. We are very much interested in participating. We are going to pursue different implementations of our ideas, but we hope to continue to work together on best practices in preprint publishing.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Is there now a competition between ESSOAr and EarthArXiv?</span><br/>
The AGU's Earth and Space Science Open Archive (ESSOAr) presents an alternative place to publish. In that regard, we will compete for papers. But, I view it more as this is how science works. Anyone is able to put their ideas out there for debate, testing, and validation. We differ with AGU over implementation and we are offering the community an alternative. Now we'll have to wait and see what they think.</p>
