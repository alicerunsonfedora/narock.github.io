           <p>The Semantic Web is an inherently multi-disciplinary field. The Artificial Intelligence community has contributed much in the way of formal logic and knowledge representation. Similarly, the applied computer science community, along with industry and government agencies, have contributed with application development and testing.  With an ever-growing dependence on the web, natural science researchers, geoscience and biology to name a few, have also taken an increasing interest in the Semantic Web.</p>

           <p>Yet, the division between computer science, natural science, and academia/government/industry, has a downside. It limits the formation of a coherent national agenda for exploring emerging trends in Semantic Technologies.  What are needed are community consolidation and the building of a U.S.-based community research network.</p>

           <p>The goal of the 1st U.S. Semantics Symposium is to bring together the U.S. Semantic Web community and begin forming such a research network.  We aim to achieve this by supporting communication across disciplinary, organizational, and geographical boundaries.  The Symposium will provide a forum by which participants can share information and ideas, coordinate ongoing or planned research activities, foster synthesis and new collaborations, develop community standards, and advance their science and education through communication and the sharing of ideas.</p>

           <p>To this end, the Symposium will be an informal gathering with plenty of time for discussion and breakout sessions. We encourage anyone with an interest in the Semantic Web, regardless of field, to attend.</p> 

           <p>The symposium will be held as a one and a half days event on August 18 and 19, 2016, ending at noon on August 19. It will take place at the Arlington Gateway hotel in Arlington, VA.</p>

       <h2>Venue Information</h2>
         The symposium will be held at the <a href="http://www.westinarlingtongateway.com/">Westin Arlington Gateway</a> in Arlington, VA. A block of 75 rooms is being held at the per diem rate of $174 plus tax. Reservations can be made by calling 1-888-627-7076 and mentioning the U3S Symposium.

            $199 per night, 5 minute walk to the symposium venue

         The symposium venue and surrounding hotels are easily accessible from both Ronald Reagan National Airport as well as Dulles International Airport. Both offer <a href="http://www.wmata.com/getting_around/new_metro/">metro bus and train access</a> to the Arlingon area where the symposium is being held. Metro train fares change throughout the day. However, traveling by metro train from National Airport is typically not more than $5 each way. The metro train has a dedicated stop at Ronald Reagan National Airport making travel from this airport a bit easier. Taxis are also readily available at both airports.

         <br/><br/>The prefered metro stop in Arlington is Ballston on the Orange Line. From here it is a
